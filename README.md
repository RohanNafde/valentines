# 💌 Will You Be My Valentine?

A cute, interactive web-based Valentine's Day proposal. This project features a playful "Yes/No" mechanic where the "No" button is elusive, and the "Yes" button grows until it's the only option!

## ✨ Features

* **Interactive Buttons:**
  * **No Button:** Runs away, changes text to guilt-trip the user (playfully!), and eventually resets if they are too stubborn.
    * **Yes Button:** Grows in size with every rejection of the "No" button.
* **Dynamic Media:** Changes GIFs/Images based on the user's choices.
* **Confetti & Effects:** Floating hearts background and smooth animations.
* **PDF Letter:** A hidden feature that allows the special person to open a digital letter after they say "Yes."
* **Mobile Responsive:** Works on phones and desktops.
